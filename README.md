# Entrando Tracker

A simple entrance randomizer tracker. There is no logic for tracking accessible entrances. Has some extra features for making criss-cross easier to track.

## Usage

* Right clicking markers hides them.
* Click markers to select, and click on the map to place.
* Right clicking the map in the bottom right clears all overworld item markers.
* Hovering over a connector will draw lines to all linked connectors.
* Right clicking a dungeon notes button in the bottom right will increment the check counter.
* Clicking on a marker while dungeon notes are open will let you make a path to get to that check.

This is built on [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org) if you want to make changes or add networking to it.
