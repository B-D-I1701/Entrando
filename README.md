# Entrando Tracker

A simple entrance randomizer tracker. There is no logic for tracking accessible entrances. Has some extra features for making criss-cross easier to track.

You can download it [here](https://github.com/rainbowism/Entrando/releases), and the html5 version is available [here](https://rainbowism.com/entrando/).

## Usage

* Map in the bottom right is an options menu.
* Right clicking markers hides them.
* Click markers to select, and click (or drag) on the map to place.
* Hovering over a connector will draw lines to all linked connectors.
* Right clicking a dungeon notes button in the bottom right will increment the check counter.
* Clicking on a marker while dungeon notes are open will let you make a path to get to that check.
* Ctrl+Z to unhide markers, up to 10.
